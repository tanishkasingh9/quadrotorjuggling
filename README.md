# quadrotorjuggling
Quadcopter juggling ball using Reinforcement Learning

to start, replace the hector_quadrotor_description folder with the one in the repository. 
quadrotor_base1.dae in the meshes folder has the 3D construct of the quadrotor hector with the platform. Replace the path for the .dae file of quadrotor_base to quadrotor_base1 in the quadrotor_base.urdf.xacro file in urdf folder.


*COMING SOON*
1. learning how to fly.
2. Simulate a ball in Gazebo
3. Perform Q-Learning and SARSA to maximize bounces on the platform.
4. DO we need more sensors?
